Personal blog/resume website using samarsault's texture theme for Jekyll.

Note: I wanted to use custom plugins (notably, [jekyll-target-blank](https://github.com/keithmifsud/jekyll-target-blank)), but GitHub Pages doesn't allow custom plugins by default, citing security concerns.
For more control over your site, including the use of custom plugins, you can deploy your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages with [GitHub Actions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/).
